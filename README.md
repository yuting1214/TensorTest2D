# TensorTest2D
An implementation of fitting generalized linear models on second-order tensor type data. The functions within this package mainly focus on parameter estimation, including parameter coefficients and standard deviation.

# Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/yuting1214/TensorTest2D
R CMD INSTALL TensorTest2D
```
or in R console window type the following
```
install.packages("TensorTest2D")
```
